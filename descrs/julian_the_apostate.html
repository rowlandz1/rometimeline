Julian was born in Constantinople to Christian parents. After the death of Constantine,
he retreated to intellectual study of Christian and classic Greek literature and
philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the mysticism of Neoplatonism and developed
beliefs in theurgy, divination, and the importance of animal sacrifice. In 351, Julian
privately rejected his Christian upbringing. In 355, Julian was appointed by Constantius to be
Caesar of the west. Although more naturally inclined to private study, the ambitious Julian was
determined to master the military demands of his new position. He won crucial victories against
invading German tribes and respect from his soldiers.

When Constantius died in 361, Julian became sole emperor and wasted no time trying to undo all
the work of Diocletian and Constantine. He abandoned the quasi-divine emperor charade,
shrank the imperial court and bureaucracy, and redistributed governing power to city
and province leaders. However, these reforms mostly caused confusion and didn't last
beyond Julian's short reign. More famously, Julian attempted to orchestrate an empire-wide
pagan revival by limiting Christians' access to imperial leadership positions. One of his
most savvy political moves was his Tolerance Edict which declared all religions
equal in the eyes of the state. He reasoned that without imperial sponsorship of "mainstream"
Christianity, the incohesive religion would be torn apart by its own internal divisions.

World history may have been radically different had Julian lived longer. However, his reforms
came to a screetching halt when Julian was shot with an arrow in battle during a campaign
against the Persians. No doubt, the visionary Julian aspired to be one of the Antonines with
their long reigns over a stable and vibrant Roman era. But the crisis years and subsequent
reforms had left the empire a vastly different place, and two years was simply not enough
time.
