In 376, a hoard of Goths crossed the Danube seeking refuge from the Huns.
After enduring harassment from local Roman leaders, they revolted and began rampaging
around the Balkans. Emperor Valens and the eastern army eventually confronted them in 378.
The ensuing Battle of Adrianople resulted in overwhelming victory for the Goths, whose
unaccounted-for cavalry surrounded and slaughtered Valens and two-thirds of the veteran
eastern army. What followed was a war of attrition as Gothic forces proved unable to
capture the heavily fortified Roman cities and the crippled Roman army was no match for
the Goths in open combat. In 382, breaking from centuries-old Roman foreign policy, the
Goths were allowed to remain on Roman territory as a unified nation with fragile loyalty
to Rome.

The Gothic War marks when the Roman legions, long suffering from manpower shortages, bega
to have serious problems defending the empire from hostile barbarians and internal
political usurpers.
