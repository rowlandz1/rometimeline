Constantine is famous for being the emperor who converted Rome to Christianity; and that
legacy is certainly well-deserved. His religious convictions influenced nearly every action
he took before and after his rise to power, and his unyielding insistance on a single
national religion profoundly changed world history. As sole emperor, he built churches,
issued morality laws, gave preference to Christians for public positions, and even outlawed
the millenium-old pagan practices of divination and sacrifice.

Though eventually a fervant Christian, it is difficult to trace
his precise religious opinions up to the time he became sole emperor.
The rhetoric during his early reign was vaguely monotheistic, but didn't commit to any single
belief system. It appears that Constantine was searching for the \"correct\" faith during his
rise to power, and later retroactively attributed his successes to the Christian God.
His vague religious posture may have been a conscious choice to appeal to a wide range of
potential supporters. An idealist,
Constantine may have sought to leverage the organization of the early Church heirarchy, contrasted
with independent local pagan practice, as a tool of unification.

Constantine's monetary policy ultimately separated Romans economically rather than unifying them.
While Diocletian had basically abandoned currency, Constantine introduced the gold solidus which
would form the backbone of the eastern and western economies for hundreds of years. However, he
neglected to stabilize silver and bronze currency which worsened inequality between rich and poor.
He also introduced a commercial tax which forced many members of the lower classes to become
indentured servants to wealthy landowners. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners, with their new workers,
made their estates more self-sufficient to reduce the amount they owed, becoming the
precursors of Medieval fiefdoms.
