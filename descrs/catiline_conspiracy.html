After two expensive propaganda campaigns to win the consular elections of 64 an 63 BCE, Catiline's debt forced him to resort to extra-legal means of securing power. He rhetorically placed himself as a populist savior advocating debt forgiveness, while amassing a makeshift army north of Rome. However, the winnng consul Cicero, with inside intelligence, slowly collected evidence of Cataline's plans at a power grab. On December 8, Cicero exposed the conspiracy at a Senate meeting, with Cataline in attendence. Cataline attempted to defend himself by appealing to his prestigious Roman anscestry, but his reputation was ruined and he was forced to flee the city.

Cicero's speech became a famous example of his oratory skill and of Latin rhetoric in general, and has been copied, circulated, and quoted ever since. It represents the success of republican institutions in warding off the ever-present threat of autocracy.
