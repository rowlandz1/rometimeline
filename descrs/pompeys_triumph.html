In 61 BCE, Pompey held a massive triumph in Rome for his victories in the East against
King Mithridates. The extravegance and megalomania on display contributed to establishing
an aura of untouchability and omnipotence around the gifted commander in the public eye.
The East had long standing traditions of divinizing powerful earthly kings and conquerers,
and Pompey got used to being propped up as a god-like figure. In contrast, Roman Republican
tradition had always been downplayed this style of idol-worship out of respect for the unity
of the Senatorial aristocracy. But Pompey's
lavish self-promotion demonstrated how singular figures were becoming more important in the
public imagination of Rome. His style would be copied by Julius Caesar and later emperors as
a means of drawing power from the people, and away from the Senate.
