The Sicilian city of Messana was occupied by the Mamertines, a mercenary group from Campania.
Their control of the city was threatened when Hiero II came to power in Syracuse with ambitions
of controlling the entire Sicilian island. The Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage
for assistance. The Carthaginians gladly accepted the offer and started building a
garrison in Messana, but the Mamertines started to question their motives. The city had been under
Carthaginian control several decades ago before being illegally siezed by the Mamertines. Now with two
likely enemies, the Mamertines redoubled their appeals to Rome.
The Romans were hesitant to get involved because they had just expelled a group of unlawful occupiers from
the rightfully Roman city of Rhegium, so aiding the Mamertines was just begging for accusations of
hipocracy. The Romans were also conflicted over whether provoking war with their strongest rival was wise.
But the prospect of gaining a foothold on valuable Sicily was convincing enough.

<p>
The Romans chartered a small
fleet of Greek ships from Tarentum to sail to Messana. The Mamertines welcomed the Romans and the Carthaginians
withdrew from their garrison. The leader of the garrison was crucified by the Carthaginian Senate for withdrawing.
Carthage and Syracuse, though longtime rivals, decided to form a tentative alliance and deployed armies to siege
Messana. But the armies were reluctant to help each other and the legions were able to drive them off separately.
The alliance broke down after Rome promised Syracuse to respect their sovereignty in exchange for military aid
against Carthage. With the Syracusan threat neutralized, Rome advanced on the rest of Sicily, but was unable to
take the fortified western strongholds. A stalemate ensued with Rome holding the upper-hand on land while
Carthage maintained control of the sea.

In 261, the Romans decided to take the fight to Carthage by constructing a navy based on the design of a
shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme. Rome's first forays onto the sea are a testament to their ingenuity,
adaptiveness, and bullheaded persistance in the face of failure. They suffered both embarassing
defeats and surprising victories. Their navy was destroyed and rebuilt three times over the course of the
war.

The middle years of the war saw both sides making blunders that prolonged the stalemate.
In 256, Rome decided to make a bold move and landed legions in Africa to advance on Carthage itself. Resistance
to the legions proved to be inadequate, and so a spooked Carthaginian Senate sent envoys to negotiate peace before
the city was taken. However, the greedy Roman commander Regulus made demands so great that the envoys were
practically forced to refuse and allow the war to continue.
The Spartan mercenary commander Xanthippus was given command of the Carthaginian army, who led them in victory
against the Romans in the Battle of Tunis. But the nobility of Carthage got jealous of his success and forced
him to accept his pay and return to Greece.

<p>
Both sides were quickly losing interest in the war.
Without a navy, Rome couldn't dislodge the Carthaginians from their strongholds in Sicily, and the new
Carthaginian army commander Hamilcar, lacking proper funding, resorted to running a guerilla campaign
against the Roman presence.
Rome decided to make one last move. In 243, They build a fleet (the fourth one).
They blockaded Lilybaeum and Drepana. Carthage launched their entire fleet to drive them off, but this time, the
Carthaginian fleet was less experienced than the Roman fleet, and so they lost. With the siege finally working,
Hamilcar negotiated with the Romans. Carthage ceaded all of their Sicilian territory and promised to leave
Syracuse alone. Gold paid, prisoners released.
