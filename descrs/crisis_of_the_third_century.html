During the mid-third century, the empire nearly fell apart due to a
combination of political instability, external invasion, plague, and economic depression.
The seeds of the late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages were sown during the crisis
years: decreased defense along the northern frontiers, increased city defenses, the
decline of the legions, the breakdown of internal trade networks, growing inequality,
and the breakdown of the middle class.

The Severans had set a precedent for emperors to give large donatives and
frequent wage increases to the soldiers to prevent rebellion. The army came to
feel so entitled to these benefits that pandering to the army became the only
source of imperial legitimacy. Troops elevated their generals to emperor upon
glorious victory fueling perpetual civil war. Emperors were deposed by rival
generals or when they simply fell out of favor with the army.
This breakdown of imperial legitimacy exacerbated external threats and crippled
the Roman response. Germanic tribes took notice of the political mess and
and conducted raids across the extensive Rhine and Danube frontiers. Meanwhile,
the sitting emperor was forced to deal with these threats himself instead of
creating potential usurpers by delegating military responsibility to competent
generals. Additionally, the Cyprian plague caused widespread manpower shortages
that affected army recruitment and economic productivity.

The unreasonable monetary demands of the army were also straining the imperial
tax system leading emperors to resort to tampering with the Roman currency.
Frequent debasement and minting lead to massive inflation such that the western
empire nearly reverted to a barter system.
