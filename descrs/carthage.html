The Carthaginians ruled over a powerful trade-based empire in the western
Mediterranean. Before being eclipsed by Rome, ancient Carthage had been the leading
economic and military power in the region for hundreds of years. The empire was
ruled from the city of Carthage, strategically located on the strait between
Africa and Sicily. The city was founded by Phoenicians around 800 BCE. The Romans
called them the "Punic" people which derives from the word "Phoenician".

The social and governmental structures of Carthage were comparable to those of
Rome except that social status was determined almost exclusively by wealth. The
government was run by a Senate of the wealthiest Carthaginians. Executive and
judicial power was held by two annually elected men called "sufetes" which were
comparable to the Roman consuls except for their lack of any military authority.
The focus on wealth meant that Carthage did not have a class struggle analogous
to the patrician-plebian conflict. All citizens had a chance, if perhaps a slim
chance, of gaining political power by getting rich. However, this also meant that
the lower classes of Carthage had significantly less political power than the
lower classes of Rome.

The pride of the Carthaginian military was its navy, but the army was also
important for furthering economic interests. The Carthaginians were not warriors
at heart, so they relied on mercenary troops or auxiliaries from client states to
perform much of the actual fighting. Cavalry from Numidia and infantry from Iberia
were particularly valuable. The largely mercenary-based army of Carthage contrasted
starkly with the citizen-based army of Rome, and largely accounts for why Rome was
able to hold out against Carthage during the Punic Wars even after major defeats.
