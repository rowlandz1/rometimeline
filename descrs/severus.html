Being the first major emperor after the Antonine dynasty, his legitimacy was critically
low beginning his reign. In 193, he was hailed emperor by his troops in Pannonia and thrust into
competition with his rival claimants. His place in power was given and maintained by the army
alone. Aware of his fragile authority, Severus gave large donatives and increased the wage of his
soldiers. He created new legions and reorganized the Praetorian Guard into a personal army of
fifty-thousand men. Having little interest in the charade of republicanism, he ignored the Senate
and Roman aristocracy. The increased military spending prompted Severus to debase the silver
denarius from 81% to only 54% silver.

Severus is usually remembered as an effective ruler who waged several successful military campaigns
and fixed much of the financial damage caused by Commodus. However, the soldier wage increase and
coinage debasement contributed to the military anarchy and economic collapse of the third century.
