Roman accounts of the early Republic describe a major class conflict between the
minority aristocratic patricians and the common plebians, which is known today as
the Conflict of the Orders. This centuries-long struggle began in 494 BCE with the
first of several plebeian 'secessions' or withdrawals.

The plebians wanted to abolish debt bondage, the practice of enslaving debtors until
the debt could be paid back. To force the hand of the patricians, the citizens
organized a mass walk-out of the city, not unlike a modern day strike. Although
debt bondage would not be abolished until 326 BCE, the plebeians did score political
representation in the new office of tribune (<em>tribuni plebis</em>).
