The Social War erupted from tension over the status of non-Roman Italians within
the increasingly multi-ethnic empire. Ever since Rome's initial conquest of the
peninsula, there were struggles over whether the Italians were subjects or allies.
Italian communities participated in Roman wars and benefited from the spoils.
The wealthy classes of Italians became increasingly intertwined with the economic
and political elite in Rome; 'Dual citizenship' of Rome and a native Italian city
became increasingly common. However, there was still plenty of prejudice both ways;
Romans considered Italians to be second-class citizens and Italians accused Romans
of being tyrannical overlords.

In 91 BCE, a Roman envoy insulted the people of Asculum who retaliated by unleashing
a mass murder of the Romans in the city. Rome declared war, and the Italian cities
quickly split into pro- and anti-Roman factions. There is some debate over exactly
what the rebels were fighting for. Contemporary Roman accounts claim that the
primary goal was to eliminate the distinction between Romans and Italians, i.e. full
integration into the empire. But other evidence, such as the coin shown below,
suggests political independence, not unification, as a more likely aim. The rebels
were eventually subdued, but at considerable cost. Roman citizenship was granted to
the loyal Italian cities and soon to all of Italy.

The Social War is largely remembered as an unfortunate and avoidable conflict
precipitated by lingering racial bias.
