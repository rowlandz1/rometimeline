Little is known of the actual origins of the city. The archaeological record indicates that Rome developed from various Italic tribes who migrated from the Alban Hills into the agriculturally-superior valley near the Tiber River. The discovery of some fortification walls on the Palatine Hill that probably date to the mid-eighth century BC seem to justify the traditional 753 BC date for the city's founding as reasonable.

According to legend, Rome was founded by Romulus who was born with his twin brother Remus in Alba Longa to the vestal virgin Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Seen by the king as a threat to power, they were abandoned at birth and raised by a she-wolf. As young adults, the twins decided to build a city of their own in the area near the Tiber River, but they disagreed on which hill to build it. Romulus preferred the Palatine Hill while Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. They decided leave the choice to the gods through a contest of augury. Remus first saw six auspicious birds but soon afterward Romulus saw twelve, and claimed to have won divine approval. Remus disagreed with this interpretation, so Romulus murdered him and founded the city himself.

The Romans' origin story reveals much of how they understood themselves as a people. They are fighters at heart, though tempered by religious ritual and superstition. They built civilization from savagery, greatness from humble beginnings.
