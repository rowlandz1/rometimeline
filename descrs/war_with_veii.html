Around 400 BCE, the Romans annexed the Etruscan city of Veii, twelve miles
away on coveted land north of the Tiber river.
Livy and other Roman sources tell the story of the siege of Veii as the Roman equivalent
of the Trojan War. The siege of the heavily fortified city supposedly took ten
years, the same length as the siege of Troy. The prolonged military activity
prompted the introduction of a year-round standing army that received pay from state
taxes (although no currency would have existed at this time). The story culminates with
the Romans digging a tunnel leading into the city's main citadel and attacked the
unsuspecting Veientes from within. Veii was plundered and the inhabitants killed and
enslaved. In reality, archeological exploration around the site has not uncovered any
evidence of large scale destruction or genocide, and the integration was probably more
gradual.

Though Roman accounts are highly mythologized, the 300s BCE is likely when Rome first
started to expand its control and influence beyond its small neighborhood of Latium.
Roman territory grew by 60% and the Roman identity had to be stretched to include a
foreign people. The riches of Veii would have certainly been a boon to further military
endeavors and whetted the appetite for foreign conquest. Livy's claims of a year-round
army and soldier pay may point to the army becoming more centralized and state-run.
The fall of Veii also forshadows the fall of the Etruscans at large who would soon be
squeezed out of existance by the expanding Romans to the south and invading Gallic tribes
to the north.
