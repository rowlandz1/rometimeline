The Etruscan city of Veii had long been a rival of Rome. It was situated just twelve
miles away on highly coveted land north of the Tiber river. Around the turn of the
century, Rome felt militarily secure enough to finally make a move.
For years, the Romans were unable to take the heavily fortified city. Finally, dictator Marcus
Verias Camillus set his men digging a mine that led directly into Veii's citadel. When the
mine was complete, a small group of soldiers infiltrated the citadel and threw open the
gates of the city to the rest of the army. The Romans slaughtered the shocked citizens
and hauled off the city's riches. The city would later be resettled by Romans.

The conflict with Veii was a milestone for Romans and a turning point for the Italian region as
a whole. The Romans' prolonged siege required them to field an army year-round, a previously
unprecedented policy. To placate the soldiers, who could not go back to their farms, soldier-pay
was introduced for the first time. The destruction of Veii would also mark the end of Etruscan
dominance over the northern Italian peninsula. The disunited Etruscan city-states would be
squeezed by the expanding Romans to the south and invading Gallic tribes to the north.
