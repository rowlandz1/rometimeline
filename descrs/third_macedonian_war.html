In 179 BCE, King Philip V of Macedon died, leaving power to his ambitious, anti-Roman
son Perseus. He tried to forge an alliance with the Seleucid Empire by marrying the
Seleucid king's daughter. The possibility of such an alliance worried the kingdom of
Pergamum, a Roman ally, which bordered both kingdoms, and they sent envoys to Rome
asking for intervention. Eventually they agreed after revolts broke out in Illyria which
were suspected to have been started by Perseus.

An early victory for Macedon at Callinicus caused much of the rest of Greece, tired of
Roman presence in their land, to join Perseus. For two years, the discipline of the
Roman armies broke down for some reason and they resorted to pillaging Greek cities
instead of confronting the enemy army. In 168 BCE, Paulus the Younger was elected consul
and restored order.

The war concluded with the battle of Pydna, during which Perseus was captured. An independent
Macedon no longer existed and the kingdom was partitioned into four republics. Each had to pay
a tribute to Rome and were forbidden from trading with each other.
