From the mid 500s BCE until the Second Samnite War, the Roman armies predominantly used the Greek phalanx formation.
</p>

<p>
A phalanx was a tight block of spearmen called hoplites.
The large oval shields of the front line formed a shield wall, and the spears of the first several rows of men stuck out through
the gaps between the shields. The men in the back rows were there to replace fallen men in the front and to physically
brace the front rows from being pushed back by the opposing army. An effective phalanx maintained an unbroken front
line and advanced steadily forward. The disciplined and coordinated attack of the phalanx was highly effective against chaotic
barbarian hoard armies who trained in up-close hand-to-hand combat.

<p>
The phalanx had a few critical weaknesses which were discovered by the Romans while fighting the Samnites.
The strength of the phalanx depended on maintaining formation, so it was less effective on rugged terrain such as the
mountainous territory of Samnium. The phalanx was also not
very manuverable and could be easily flanked by cavalry, or broken by a surprise attack from the side. Once the formation is
broken, the individual hoplites are ill-equipped for individual combat.

The manipular legion was designed to address the problems of the Greek phalanx. A legion was composed of three lines of maniples
arranged in a checkerboard pattern. A maniple was made of two centuries, and each century was a block of roughly sixty to a
hundred men. Each century was led by a centurion, and the senior of the two centurions led the whole maniple. The legion's front
line, the hastati, was composed of the youngest soldiers who had the most stamina. The next line, the principes, was brought in
to support the front line. Finally, the third line, the triarii, was composed of the most veteran soldiers who were only brought
in when the fighting was really rough. On each of the ends of the army were the equites, cavalry.
