According to tradition, Tarquinius Superbus was a cruel tyrant who cemented a hatred of kings among the Roman population and was overthrown by popular uprising. The new republic was able to successfully ward off plots and external invasion aimed to reinstate Tarquinius. However, the prevalent modern view is that the monarchy at Rome was incidentally terminated through military defeat and foreign intervention. Porsenna, the Etruscan king of Clusium, defeated the Romans and expelled Tarquinius Superbus (Britannica). The traditional 509 BCE date is also highly suspected of being a fabrication of later Romans who wanted the establishent of democracy in Rome to predate that of Athens.

The king was replaced by two anually elected consuls who held absolute power, but had to relinquish it after a year. Additionally, one consul could veto the actions of his colleague. The early Roman Republic was more of an oligarchy of Patrician families wielding power over the lower classes.
