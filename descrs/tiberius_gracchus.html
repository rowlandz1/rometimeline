Tiberius Gracchus was a populist politician and political reformer, the
first of several similar reformers including his brother Gaius Gracchus,
Marius, and Julius Caesar. As tribune in 133 BCE, he introduced legislation
to settle the urban poor as farmers on public land. The Senatorial elite
were outraged and murdered him as he stood for re-election.

The reasons for Tiberius's populist stance are unknown. On one account, he
was traveling once through Etruria and was shocked by the sight of large
farm estates run by slaves that had replaced the once dominant small peasant farms.
However, historians doubt the story's
credibility because it is likely that small farmers were still prominent at this
time.

In 133 BCE, King Attalus of Pergamum died and left his kingdom to 'the Roman people'.
The vagueness of the intended recipient sparked debate over who the large fortune should
benefit. Tiberius argued that 'the Roman people' meant the commoners and arranged for
the convenient fortune to pay for the logistical costs of his land redistribution plan.
The redistribution was unsurprisingly wildly popular among the common poor; it was reported
that urban dwellers from the surrounding Latin communities travelled to Rome in large numbers
specifically to vote for it. However, populist figures
commonly came under fire from the Senatorial class for haivng kingly aspirations.
Tiberius decided to run for tribune again which would protect him from prosecution, but
during the election proceedings, violence broke out and Tiberius was killed by a gang of
Senators and their supporters. The murder did not halt the land redistribution which
continued for a few years.
