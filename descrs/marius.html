Gaius Marius was a skilled commander and populist politician whose career
contributed to Rome's gradual slide into autocracy. He was elected consul
an unprecedented seven times, five times in a row from 104 - 100 BCE.
His army, by accepting landless conscripts, set a precedent of personal
loyalty to its commander rather than the Roman state, an arrangement that
would be exploited by later popular figures like the Caesars.
