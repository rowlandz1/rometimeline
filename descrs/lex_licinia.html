Around the mid 300s BCE, it is likely the familiar political institutions of the
Republic first became official and permenant. Although sources conflict on specific details
and likely over-dramatize the plebians' struggle for political representation. According
to Livy, the consular tribunes Sextius and Licinius had proposed a
law that would require one of the annual consuls to be a plebeian. The law initially
met heavy resistance from the patricians, but was eventually instituted in 367 along
with the abolishment of the now obsolete office of tribune. However, even Roman records
indicate that there were plebeian consuls before 367 as well as years with two patrician
consuls after.

More likely is that 367 is when the consulship first solidified as the permenant official
head of state. Roman records list the consular tribunes as the chief officials of the state
for most of the years after the Twelve Tables. However, this pattern abruptly stops at 367
when consuls take over the list. It is also possible that the mid fourth century was when
the Senate similarly became an official governing body instead of just an ad hoc group of
powerful men.
