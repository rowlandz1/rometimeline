The Council of Nicea was a meeting of bishops from all over the empire, called by
Constantine, to settle schisms within Christianity, particularly the dispute between the Arians
and cosubstantialists. Constantine himself, overseeing the proceedings, did not advocate for any
particular position, but insisted that orthodoxy be established and that unity within the
empire's new religion was of utmost importance.

The council was partially successful in achieving Constantine's dream of a unified Christianity.
It did much to foster connection between Christians across the empire and establish an official
doctrine. However, the newly declared heretical beliefs did not disappear overnight. The Arians,
for example, would fight bitterly for another several hundred years until their extinction.
