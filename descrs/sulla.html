Lucius Cornelius Sulla was a general and political leader who secured dictatorial
powers and enacted sweeping reforms to the political structure of Rome. A staunch
conservative, he saw himself as a restorer of the old Republican order, even though,
as was common in Roman politics, his 'restoration' entailed an unprecedented
transformation of the governing apparatus.

Sulla was elected consul in 88 BCE and was selected to lead the ongoing war with
King Mithridates of Pontus. But Marius, wanting one more chance at glory and riches,
forced the Senate to appoint himself instead, allegedly, by literally throwing out
Senators who would have voted against him. To put an end to the chaos, Sulla marched
his army into Rome itself, an act which was illegal. Marius and his supporters were
expelled.

While Sulla was fighting in the east, Marius retook the city and purged his enemy's
supporters. In 82 BCE, Sulla marched on Rome a second time and ordered political
purges of his own resulting in around 9,000 dead, many of whom had no connection with
the Marian faction. The Senate declared him dictator with no term limit and special
powers to enact or repeal any laws for the purpose of 'restoring the republic'. He
proceeded to carry out the most ambitious wave of political reforms to date before
retiring from his dictatorship in 79 BCE.

Sulla's reforms aimed to stabilize Rome's Republican governing structure to prevent
future ambitious politicians from gaining power as he himself had done. He instituted
a set of prerequisites for holding public office called the <em>cursus honorum</em>
'course of honors' to avoid the appointment of inexperienced office holders. Prospective
consuls how had to climb a heirarchical structure of offices on their way to the most
powerful position in the empire. He reinforced the power of the Senate and decreased the
power of the tribunate. He canceled many of the revolutionary reforms of Gaius Gracchus
such as the subsidized corn.
