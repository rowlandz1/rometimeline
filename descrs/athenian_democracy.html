The advent of democracy sparked social change that transformed Athens into
the preeminent city-state in Greece during the fifth-century. Much of the
cultural, political, and economic legacy of classical Greece originated here
such as
the columned architectural style of the Parthenon,
economic specialization and living above subsistance,
legendary battles with Persia and Sparta,
and the philosophy of Socrates and Plato.
At its height,
Athens was able to impose quasi-imperial rule over hundreds of Greek settlements
on the Aegean coast. The city's population grew to around 300,000 while the
population of the Greek world as a whole grew to nearly 10 million, comparable
to modern levels.

Athens took its first steps toward democracy a century earlier with the Solonian Reforms,
but an era of tyranny followed. Then in
508 BCE, the citizen body successfully resisted the installation of Spartan puppet
rulers in favor of populist aristocrat Cleisthenes. Obliged to make good on his political
promises, Cleisthenes continued the Solonian efforts and established the first democratic
government in Greece. Decisions were made and implemented by a Council of 500
annually-appointed citizens from ten geographical regions (tribes) of Attica. Councilers
were drawn from the new class of citizens which included every 18+ male resident of Attica.

Democracy was a big part of what made fifth-century Athens a period of
flourishing. Once the government was wrested out of elite hands, the
relationship between the state and the people became mutually beneficial.
The state funded public architecture and cultural events. The construction of city walls and
a navy (the largest in Greece) provided protect against invasion
and facilitated trade across the Aegean by eliminating piracy. When a massive Persian invasion
threatened the Greek mainland in 481 BCE, the enormous effort was taken to
evacuate the citizen population of the city to safety in the Peloponnese.
In return, the citizen soldiers gained a boost of motivation to defend the
city since their personal well-being was tied to that of the community.

In many respects, the political histories of Rome and Athens are similar.
Both began as relatively minor city-states until a political revolution
enabled them to eclipse their neighbors in wealth and power and collect
tribute across a wide expanse of territory. But while Athenian hegemony
collapsed, Rome went on to establish a transcontinental empire. The
difference might lie with each society's understanding of citizenship.
Both city-states extended citizenship beyond their immediate metropolitian
areas, Athens to all free men of Attica, Rome to Latins and elite Italians.
However, the proliferation of citizenship never reached the numerous tributary
states of the Athenian empire. The strong local identities and political
affiliations of the Greek world prevented the Delian League from surpassing,
in the minds of Greek subjects, a defensive military alliance. The Romans
handed out citizenship much more liberally because the Roman identity was
defined by militaristic traditions, which could and were adopted by others,
more so than the location and ethnic makeup of Rome itself.
