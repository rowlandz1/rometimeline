At the close of the First Samnite War, the Campanians and Latins wanted
to keep fighting to stamp out Samnite aggression and extract more spoils. Some of
the Latin tribes took Rome's unwillingness to continue as a sign of weakness and
rebelled. Being neighbors and former allies, the Roman and Latin armies were similar
in almost every way, from formation to tactics to equipment. However, the Roman
forces simply proved to be stronger. Latin independence from Rome was crushed once
and for all.

The Romans' treatment of the defeated Latins is one of the first clear instances of
typical Roman foreign policy toward conquered peoples. Each tribe received treatment
based on its degree of hostility toward Rome. Tribes that never joined the rebellion
were granted full Roman citizenship while the most rebellious tribes were driven off
their land, which was recolonized.
