Born Gaius Octavius, Augustus demonstrated remarkable ability in oratory, politics, and administration during his formative years under the eye of his uncle Julius Caesar. Upon Caesar's death, his will revealed that he was postumusly adopting the nineteen-year-old Gaius and leaving him with three-forths of his fortune. Now Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, he would soon out-compete Mark Antony and the anti-Caesarians for support from the Senate, legions, and citizens to become the most powerful man in Rome. In 27 BC, the Senate granted him the title 'Augustus' making him the first of the people retroactively called the Roman emperors. His charisma, skill, generosity, and longevity cemented the transition from republic to empire.

<p>
<b>Administrative</b> He built a permanent civil-service and administrative bureaucracy consisting
of slaves and ex-slaves which provided professionalism of administration and continuity between
leadership changes. He improved the productivity of the unwieldy Senate by creating a
working-group of 30 men that actually made the legislation. He used his massive wealth to fund
infrastructure projects such as roads, horse-relay stations, and aqueducts which improved
communication and trade. He imposed a regular census to make the tax collection consistant and
fair.

<b>Diplomacy/Military</b> Augustus thought the empire would soon become over-extended if it grew
much bigger. He envisioned an empire that extended to the easily-defensible Danube
and Elbe rivers. He settled a favorable peace with the Parthians which saw the return of the Roman
legionary standards.
</p>
<p>
<b>Imperial Image and Authority</b> Augustus was the pioneer of the Princeps, or 'first citizen' model
of emperor. Wary of the stigma surrounding absolute power, he advertized himself as the restorer of
the republic. Ironically, the common Romans, tired of the old republican oligarchy, often insisted
he seize more power.
</p>
<p>
<b>Religion &amp; Morality</b> He instituted 'morality laws' to try to restore traditional Roman virtue.
He outlawed adultery, provided benefits for having children, and made it hard to be single. These
laws had little effect though. He also ushered in a revival of Roman religious practices and
festivities.
