Overtime, pressure for political reform built up on the patricians. The plebians were tired of fighting in Rome's army while the patricians sat on the sidelines and reaped the spoils of war. Additionally, travelers from Magna Graecia brought news of Solon's political reforms in Athens. The biggest demand of the plebians was that Roman law be codified to protect against patrician subjectivity. So in 451 BCE, the laws of Rome were collected and inscribed on twelve bronze tablets to be publically displayed in the forum. These Twelve Tables covered a wide range of issues such as payment of debts, inheritance rights, upkeep of public sewers, divorce, and property boundary issues. Roman litigiousness is on display with a law that prescribed the death penalty for perjury, and a clause that forbade marriage between patrician and plebian would cause social friction by blocking plebians from the highest political offices.

The Twelve Tables marks Rome's transition to a society of laws, an essential step toward political equality. The Roman system of laws would become one of the most complex of its time and have a profound impact on European law up to the present day.
