Constantine and Maxentius met in battle outside of Rome along the Tiber River.
Although Constantine was outnumbered, the skill and loyalty of his veteran army far
exceeded that of his opponent's. Constantine won handily and became the sole ruler of the
western empire.

The battle is most famous for the alleged divine intervention that assured Constantine's
victory. As the story goes, Constantine was marching with his army when he saw a cross
above the sun and the
Greek words "In this sign, conquer" written alongside. That night, he also had
a dream in which Christ told him to use the Chi-Rho symbol to defeat his enemies.
The next morning, he painted the Chi-Rho on the shields of his soldiers and won the
battle.

Though the battle is often cited as the event that triggered Constantine's conversion to
Christianity, it is unclear whether Constantine actually attributed his successes to the Christian
God at this time. The historical details of Constantine's motivations were lost or twisted by
the Christian propaganda later in his reign. His language and symbolism were
general enough to be interpreted as either Christian or not. The Chi-Rho, for example, was already
understood as an abbreviation of the Greek word <i>chrÄ“ston</i> (good), and was used by scholars to
mark notable passages in a book. It is likely
that his vague rhetoric was a conscious political choice meant to appeal to a broad audience of
disgrungled monotheists and only retroactively changed to be explicitly Christian.
