Alexander reigned as king of Macedon from 336 until his death 13 years later. In that time, he conquered one of the largest empires known at the time, stretching from Greece and Egypt to the Indus river valley. The spread of Greek culture, language, and religious practices would massively shape the Roman Empire, particularly the eastern half.

The Greeks had always been more politically and economically connected to the lands to their east than to their west which allowed the burgeoning Roman Empire time to grow and eventually overshadow them. Alexander's eastern conquests are no exception. The world may have been drastically different if Alexander had instead prefered to conquer westward, possibly wiping out the nacent Roman Empire just barely starting to expand.
