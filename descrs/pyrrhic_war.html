The Greek cities of Magna Graecia were politically disunited and frequently
fought with each other. The Roman plan to conquer southern Italy was to play
the rival cities off each other. They would choose one city to be an ally, then use
incursions against their new ally as justification to invade rival cities in retaliation.
However, the Roman plan was disrupted when the city of Tarentum asked for aid from Pyrrhus
of Epirus. Pyrrhus wanted to establish a Greek kingdom in the west, and lept at an
opportunity to move an army into Italy.

The war with Pyrrhus was the first time Rome had fought a full authentic Greek army.
The early war was marked by slim and costly victories for the Greeks, which gives
rise to the phrase "Pyrrhic victory." The Roman army was not the disorganized barbarian
hoard that Pyrrhus was expecting. With each battle, the Romans withdrew in controlled
fashion, learned from their enemy, and regrouped stronger than before. Eventually,
Pyrrhus saw that his ambitions for an Italian kingdom were not feasible and went back
to Epirus. The Romans solidified their hold over southern Italy.
