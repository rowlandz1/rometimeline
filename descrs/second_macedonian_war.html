In 204 BCE, King Ptolemy IV of Egypt died, throwing off the balance of power
in the East. Philip V of Macedon began making advances into Thrace and western
Anatolia threatening the Kingdom of Pergamon, who sent envoys to Rome for
assistance. The Senate was initially hesitant to get involved coming off of the
Second Punic War and having no real claim to Greek territory. However, Macedon
was quickly becoming a threat to Roman power, and giving Macedon time to gather
strength was deemed unfavorable.

Rome deployed legions in 200 BCE and engaged in light skirmishes with Philip's
army throughout the year and the next. In 198 BCE, the consul Flamininus, a
proponent of Roman influence over Greece, took a much bolder stance against
Macedonian expansion. He marketed his campaigns as defensive measures to protect
the liberty of "Greece proper" which won over many Greek allies. In 197 BCE, the
Romans decisively crushed the Macedonians at Cynoscephalae. Macedon was confined
to its traditional territory and was forced to halt its expansion.

The Second Macedonian War set the stage for the conquest of Greece. Though the
Romans did not annex any land (they had no resources to do so), they now considered
the "freed" Greek city states to be in their debt. If Rome granted them their
freedom, then perhaps they were within their right to take it away. The war also
marks the major shift of military power from East to West as the Roman maniple system
proved to be undeniably superior to the Macedonian phalanx.
