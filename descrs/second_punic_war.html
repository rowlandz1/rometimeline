The Second Punic War is perhaps the most famous and impactful conflict in the
history of the Roman Republic. The infamous Carthaginian general Hannibal came
to be one of the most feared enemies for his invasion of the Italian heartland.
Not since the Gallic sack two hundred years earlier had they come so close
to destruction. But with unshakable, and at times downright illogical determination
to continue fighting, the Romans snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. The
war's conclusion left Rome the undisputed master of the Mediterranean and ushered
in the rapid expansion and political evolution of the late Republican period.
</p>
<p>
The war began in Spain when Hannibal sacked the Roman-allied city of Seguntum in
219 BCE. Rome deployed the bulk of their troops to Spain and Sicily and a small
defensive force to the Po Valley to deal with any opportunistic Gauls. To their
surprise, the small Po Valley army would face the full force of Hannibal's
invasion. War was declared in 218 BCE and Hannibal immediately set out from
Saguntum.
</p>

<h3>War in Italy</h3>
<p>
Hannibal's route to Italy was fraught with danger, and his army frequently took
heavy losses to maintain a rapid push through hostile territory. His passage
through the Alps snow set in was especially treacherous, and it is a testament
to the loyalty he commanded that his entire army didn't desert. He arrived in
the Po Valley in autumn of 218 BCE with an army of about 25,000 men. The Romans
were too hasty to engage Hannibal and suffered critical losses at Trebia and Lake
Trasimene. Hannibal learned from these early battles that he could leverage his
advantages and outsmart the Romans instead of outnumber them. The Romans, now
surely panicking, appointed as dictator Quintus Fabius Maximus who decided that
the best strategy was to pick his fights wisely and avoid a major defeat at all
costs, which came to be known as 'Fabian tactics'.
</p>
<p>
The Romans learned the value of Fabian tactics the one major time they abandoned
them. Hannibal was now running amock in Italy and Fabius's reluctance to engage
was taken as a sign of cowardice. Gaius Terentius Varro was elected consul of
216 BCE and promised a more aggressive response. He raised a massive army of
80,000 men and confronted Hannibal at Cannae. Hannibal baited Varro into a direct
frontal attack of his weaker infantry, and the Romans were surrounded by his
Numidian cavalry. Despite the almost two-to-one troop ratio, the Romans suffered
devistating losses including critical veteran leaders that nearly cost them the
entire war.
</p>
<p>
The Battle of Cannae was the pinnacle of Hannibal's career. With his stunning
victory, he paraded around southern Italy trying to coerce cities to defect
to the Carthaginian side. The Romans, incredibly, raised entirely new legions and
followed Hannibal around reasserting Roman authority and engaging in occasional
indecisive skirmishes. In 207 BCE, the monotony was broken when Hasdrubal, Hannibal's
brother, crossed the Alps and arrived in Italy with an army of 30,000 men intent on
linking up with Hannibal. However, the Romans soon routed them in the Battle of the
Metaurus. Roman control of Italy was now nearly assured, and a bitter and weary
Hannibal was finally recalled to Africa in 204 BCE.

<h3>Other Fronts</h3>
<p>
Concurrent with the Italian camgaigns, significant conflict also took place in Greece,
Sicily, and Spain. In Greece, Macedon under King Philip V made a treaty of mutual
assistance with Hannibal and sent troops west. Rome sent envoys to the other Greek
polities such as the Aetolian League to persuade them to keep Macedon occupied. The
envoys were successful and Macedon was too embroiled in the First Macedonian War to
be of much help to Hannibal.
</p>
<p>
In Sicily, longtime friend of Rome Hiero of Syracuse died in 215 BCE and a pro-Carthaginian
faction of Syracusan leaders took control of the city. In 212 BCE, the Roman army
stationed in Sicily laid siege to Syracuse which was famously defended by weapons invented
by Archimedes. The defenses weren't enough though and the Romans broke through and sacked
the city. Archimedes was killed in the chaos.
</p>
<p>
In Spain, Rome was able to secure the area between the Pyrenees mountains and the Ebro
River preventing reinforcements from reaching Hannibal. However, the situation soon turned
sour as the Roman armies suffered major defeats in 211 and 210 BCE. The Senate considered
Spain to be a lost cause and focused their attention elsewhere until Scipio's victories a
year later.
</p>

<h3>Scipio Africanus</h3>
<p>
The man who would turn a hopeless situation into a win was Publius Scipio.
In 210 BCE, Scipio arrived in Spain with 10,000 men to try to salvage the situation
there. In a bold unexected move that mirrored Hannibal's invasion of Italy, Scipio
marched on New Carthage, the center of Carthaginian presence in Iberia. The city was
heavily fortified and there was no way that his army would be able to maintain a long
siege, but a small contingent snuck into the city through a shallow lagoon to open
the gates, and the city fell. In a genius political gesture, Scipio freed the captive
leaders of the local settlements prompting a wave of defection accross Iberia to the
Roman side. In 206 BCE, the Carthaginians sent a large army in retaliation, but Scipio
drove off his outnumbered enemy using a double flanking maneuver. The Battle of Ilipa
became Scipio's version of Hannibal's victory at Cannae signaling his role as the hero
of the Second Punic War.
</p>
<p>
With persuasive success under his belt in Spain, Scipio returned to Rome to propose an
invasion of Africa to end the war. Though the Senate was reluctant, Scipio's charisma
won out and he was granted his request. He arrived the next year and linked up
with Masinissa, a Numidian prince who led a faction of cavalry disgruntled with
Carthaginian rule. The Carthaginian Senate finally recalled Hannibal from Italy and
ordered him to attack the Romans. The two legendary generals and their armies met at
Zama. The battle that followed was an evenly-matched head-on clash, but Masinissa's
cavalry and the superiority of the Roman legions carried the day. Hannibal was defeated
and Carthage surrendered.
</p>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>
Scipio was granted the agnomen 'Africanus' for his decisive victory at Zama.
Carthage was forced cede all of its overseas territories to Rome and comply with harsh
restrictions on their military engagement. The loss of Rome's most threatening rival had
vast consequences on the political evolution of the burgeoning empire. The Roman
aristocracy was left with unchecked power over the Mediterranean. Scipio had such a
personal gravitas that he unintentionally introduced cults of personality to Roman
politics.
