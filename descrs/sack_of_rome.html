Alaric, king of the Visigoths, was trying to extract concessions of land and
supplies from Emperor Honorius in Ravenna. However, after two sieges of Rome, Honorius
was still stubbornly resistant to negotiation. When Alaric's army was attacked by his
blood enemy and Roman commander Sarus, he resorted to brute force. The Goths sieged
Rome for a third time until slaves opened the Salarian gate. For three days, the Goths
beat, raped, killed, destroyed, and looted, although churches and religious artifacts
were left alone. This marks the first time Rome was sacked in nearly eight centuries.
The population of the city would in time plummet from near a million people to only
twenty-thousand.

Though of little political significance, the sack of Rome was a major blow to morale.
It fueled the growing tendency to ascribe the empire's downfall to the abandonment of
paganism, prompting Augustine's rebuttal in <i>The City of God</i>.
