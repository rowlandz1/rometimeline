The first several years of the war went well for the Romans, but in 321 BCE, the
Romans suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in their history. The Samnites
had cleverly trapped the Romans in a narrow pass called Caudine Forks. Without raising
a single sword, the Romans had to surrender. The Samnites let them go, but forced them
to pass under the yolk, a fate worse than death in the honor-crazy classical world.
Five years passed with no fighting, but the Romans recovered and for a decade fought
a war on two fronts&mdash;the Samnites to the south and their Etruscan allies to the north.
The Etruscans eventually abandoned the war effort, and the Samnites soon followed suit.

The Second Samnite War was transformative. Around this time, the Romans adopted a far more
imperialistic attitude toward its neighbors, and the Second Samnite War was one of the first
instances of Roman foreign conquest and subjegation. The Via Appia, constructed for
supplying troops in Samnium, would facilitate trade with Magna Graecia, while forts
built in Etruria projected Roman power further north. Most importantly, battling an
unfamiliar enemy in rugged terrain forced the Romans to abandon the traditional Greek
phalanx and invent the famous maniple legion. The war took Rome from being a mere
regional power to a position poised to conquer all of Italy.
