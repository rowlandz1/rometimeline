Livy describes an interesting confrontation between Hannibal and Scipio Africanus, the two legendary
generals that drove the Second Punic War. Scipio had been sent as a diplomat to the Selucid Empire
where Hannibal had sought refuge.

<blockquote>
When Africanus asked who, in Hannibal's opinion, was the greatest general, Hannibal named Alexander,
the king of the Macedonians, because with a small force he had routed armies innumerable and because
he had traversed the most distant regions even to see which transcended human hopes.
To the next request, as to whom he would rank second, Hannibal selected Pyrrhus; saying that he had been
the first to teach the art of castrametation; besides, no one had chosen his ground or placed his troops
more discriminatingly; he possessed also the art of winning men over to him, so that the Italian peoples
preferred the lordship of a foreign king to that of the Roman people, so long the master in that land.
When he continued, asking whom Hannibal considered third, he named himself without hesitation. Then
Scipio broke into a laugh and said, “What would you say if you had defeated me?” “Then, beyond doubt,”
he replied, “I should place myself both before Alexander and before Pyrrhus and before all other
generals.” Both this response, with the unexpected turn given it by Punic cleverness, and this unlooked-for
kind of flattery, he says, stirred Scipio deeply, because Hannibal had segregated him from all other
commanders as one beyond estimation.
