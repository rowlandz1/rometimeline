Like most of early Roman history, the story of Cincinnatus is
at least highly embellished, but historians largely consider him a historical
figure and the essential details of his dictatorship to be accurate.
Cincinnatus was originally a patrician of high standing, but was forced to sell 
his property and retire to a small farm to pay off a debt. In 458, the Aequians
managed to corner a Roman army on Mount Algidus. The public panicked at the
prospect of the annihilation of an army and called for Cincinnatus to be named
dictator. A small delegation met Cincinnatus on his farm and he agreed to take
on the responsibility demanded of him. Bestowed with absolute power, he led a
small army to free the trapped Roman troops and defeat the Aequians. Upon a
swift victory, he celebrated a triumph in Rome and promptly relinquished his
power to go back to his farm.

At first glance, there was nothing particularly remarkable about Cincinnatus
that would warrant his legendary status. He was neither the first dictator, nor
the only dictator to voluntarily relinquish power. However, he was the first
man to be given absolute power who had no memory of the tyranny of the monarchs.
Therefore, Cincinnatus accepted and resigned the dictatorship purely out of a
sense of duty to the Republic, not fear of monarchy. Later Romans would hold
up Cincinnatus as the model of Republican virtue&mdash;a soldier in times of war
and a laborer in times of peace.
