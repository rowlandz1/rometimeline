The city that would one day become Constantinople was probably settled sometime in the seventh century BCE. The date 657 and the traditional (certainly mythical) story comes from the historian Tacitus. Allegedly, Byzantium was founded by the Greek king Byzas from Megara. The oracle of Delphi had told him to build his new city "opposite the land of the blind." Byzas interpreted this to mean across the Bosphorus Strait from the city of Chalcedon, whose founders must have been blind to overlook this far superior location just a few miles away.
