      "descr" : "The reforms of the charismatic Diocletian lifted the empire out of the crisis era.\
      His vision was to restore the empire's glory by reshaping its every institution.<br>\
      <b>Administrative/Military Reforms</b> Diocletian sought to restore political stability by\
      distributing administrative and military duties amongst more officials, thereby allowing\
      specilization and preventing power amalgamation.\
      <ul>\
      <li>Established the Tetrarchy and voluntarily abdicated the throne, setting a\
          precedent of peaceful sharing and relinquishing of imperial power</li>\
      <li>Doubled the size of the imperial bureaucracy</li>\
      <li>Doubled the number of provinces, and grouped them into dioceses</li>\
      <li>Separated civilian and military government positions, such as establishing\
          the position of dux--the military commander in a province</li>\
      <li>Emphasized smaller and more mobile vexillation over the legion as the\
          primary military unit for patrolling the northern frontiers</li>\
      </ul>\
      <b>Economic Reforms</b> His economic reforms aimed to fund the army and bureaucracy\
      despite coin-debasement and inflation. He abandoned monetary taxation in favor of\
      direct payment of raw goods. His Edict on Prices attempted to curb inflation by\
      tabulating for each marketable good a maximum prices. However, the edict was\
      unenforceable and was abandoned after his abdication.<br>\
      <b>Imperial Image</b> Hy styled the emperorship as a divinely appointed position\
      to remove the ever-shifting allegiance of the army as the source of imperial legitimacy.\
      This shift in perception from \"first among equals\" to \"lord and master\" typically\
      marks the boundary between the Principate and Dominate forms of government.<br>\
      <b>Religious Persecutions</b> In 303, he ordered the persecution of Christians and\
      Manichaeans from fear that the pagan gods would turn their backs on Rome. However,\
      by this time, Christianity was too established and had too much sympathy to justify\
      the appalling measures taken to stamp it out.\

      The ensuing Battle of Adrianople resulted in overwhelming victory for the Goths, whose\
      unaccounted-for cavalry surrounded and slaughtered Valens and two-thirds of the veteran\
      eastern army. What followed was a war of attrition as Gothic forces proved unable to\
      capture the heavily fortified Roman cities and the crippled Roman army was no match for\
      the Goths in open combat. In 382, breaking from centuries-old Roman foreign policy, the\
      Goths were allowed to remain on Roman territory as a unified nation with fragile loyalty\
      to Rome.<br><br>\
      The Gothic War marks when the Roman legions, long suffering from manpower shortages, began\
      to have serious problems defending the empire from hostile barbarians and internal\
      political usurpers."
