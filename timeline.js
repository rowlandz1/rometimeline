      "name" : "Founding of Rome",
      "when" : "753 BCE",
      "descr" : "Little is known of the actual origins of the city. The archaeological record indicates\
      that Rome developed from various Italic tribes who migrated from the Alban Hills into the\
      agriculturally-superior valley near the Tiber River. The discovery of some fortification walls\
      on the Palatine Hill that probably date to the mid-eighth century BC seem to justify the traditional\
      753 BC date for the city's founding as reasonable.<br>\
      <br>\
      According to legend, Rome was founded by Romulus who was born with his twin brother Remus in Alba\
      Longa to the vestal virgin Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Seen by the king as a threat to power, they\
      were abandoned at birth and raised by a she-wolf. As young adults, the twins decided to build a city of\
      their own in the area near the Tiber River, but they disagreed on which hill to build it. Romulus\
      preferred the Palatine Hill while Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. They decided leave the choice to\
      the gods through a contest of augury. Remus first saw six auspicious birds but soon afterward Romulus\
      saw twelve, and claimed to have won divine approval. Remus disagreed with this interpretation, so\
      Romulus murdered him and founded the city himself.<br>\
      <br>\
      The Romans' origin story reveals much of how they understood themselves as a people. They are fighters\
      at heart, though tempered by religious ritual and superstition. They built civilization from savagery,\
      greatness from humble beginnings."

      century BCE. The date 657 and the traditional (certainly mythical) story comes from the historian Tacitus.\
      Allegedly, Byzantium was founded by the Greek king Byzas from Megara. The oracle of Delphi had told him to\
      build his new city \"opposite the land of the blind.\" Byzas interpreted this to mean across the Bosphorus\
      from the city of Chalcedon, whose founders must have been blind to overlook this far superior location just\
      a few miles away."

      "name" : "Founding of the Republic",

      "descr" : "According to tradition, Tarquinius Superbus was a cruel tyrant who cemented a hatred of kings\
      among the Roman population and was overthrown by popular uprising. The new republic\
      was able to successfully ward off plots and external invasion aimed to reinstate Tarquinius.\
      However, the prevalent modern view is that the monarchy at Rome was incidentally terminated through\
      military defeat and foreign intervention. Porsenna, the Etruscan king\
      of Clusium, defeated the Romans and expelled Tarquinius Superbus. (Britannica)\
      The traditional 509 BCE date is also highly suspected of being a fabrication of later Romans who wanted the\
      establishent of democracy in Rome to predate that of Athens.<br>\
      <br>\
      The king was replaced by two anually elected consuls who held absolute power, but had to relinquish it after\
      a year. Additionally, one consul could veto the actions of his colleague. The early Roman Republic was more of\
      an oligarchy of Patrician families wielding power over the lower classes."

      "descr" : "Overtime, pressure for political reform built up on the patricians. The plebians were getting\
      tired of the patricians using Rome's army to enhance their wealth and power. Additionally, travelers from\
      Magna Graecia brought news of Solon's political reforms in Athens. The biggest demand of the plebians was\
      that Roman law be codified to protect against patrician subjectivity. So in 451 BCE, the laws of Rome\
      were collected and inscribed on twelve bronze tablets to be publically displayed in the forum. These\
      Twelve Tables covered a wide range of issues such as payment of debts, inheritance rights, upkeep of\
      public sewers, divorce, and property boundary issues. Roman litigiousness is on display with a law that\
      prescribed the death penalty for perjury, and a clause that forbade marriage between patrician and\
      plebian would cause social friction by blocking plebians from the highest political offices.<br>\
      <br>\
      The Twelve Tables marks Rome's transition to a society of laws, an essential step toward political\
      equality. The Roman system of laws would become one of the most complex of its time and have a profound\
      impact on European law up to the present day."

      He rhetorically placed himself as a populist savior advocating debt forgiveness, while\
      amassing a makeshift army north of Rome. However, the winnng consul Cicero, with inside\
      intelligence, slowly collected evidence of Cataline's plans at a power grab. On December\
      8, Cicero exposed the conspiracy at a Senate meeting, with Cataline in attendence.\
      Cataline attempted to defend himself by appealing to his prestigious Roman anscestry,\
      but his reputation was ruined and he was forced to flee the city.<br>\
      <br>\
      Cicero's speech became a famous example of his oratory skill and of Latin rhetoric in\

      Although Constantine was outnumbered, the skill and loyalty of his veteran army far\
      exceeded that of his opponent's. Constantine won handily and became the sole ruler of the\
      western empire.<br>\
      <br>\
      The battle is most famous for the alleged divine intervention that assured Constantine's\
      victory. As the story goes, Constantine was marching with his army when he saw a cross\
      above the sun and the\
      Greek words \"In this sign, conquer\" written alongside. That night, he also had\
      a dream in which Christ told him to use the Chi-Rho symbol to defeat his enemies.\
      The next morning, he painted the Chi-Rho on the shields of his soldiers and won the\
      battle.<br>\
      <br>\
      Though the battle is often cited as the event that triggered Constantine's conversion to\
      Christianity, it is unclear whether Constantine actually attributed his successes to the Christian\
      God at this time. The historical details of Constantine's motivations were lost or twisted by\
      the Christian propaganda later in his reign. His language and symbolism were\
      general enough to be interpreted as either Christian or not. The Chi-Rho, for example, was already\
      understood as an abbreviation of the Greek word <i>chrēston</i> (good), and was used by scholars to\
      mark notable passages in a book. It is likely\
      that his vague rhetoric was a conscious political choice meant to appeal to a broad audience of\
      disgrungled monotheists and only retroactively changed to be explicitly Christian."

      particular position, but insisted that orthodoxy be established and that unity within the\
      empire's new religion was of utmost importance.<br>\
      <br>\
      The council was partially successful in achieving Constantine's dream of a unified Christianity.\
      It did much to foster connection between Christians across the empire and establish an official\
      doctrine. However, the newly declared heretical beliefs did not disappear overnight. The Arians,\
      for example, would fight bitterly for another several hundred years until their extinction."

      "descr" : "Born Gaius Octavius, Augustus demonstrated remarkable ability in oratory, politics, and\
      administration during his formative years under the eye of his uncle Julius Caesar. Upon Caesar's\
      death, his will revealed that he was postumusly adopting the nineteen-year-old Gaius and leaving him\
      with three-forths of his fortune. Now Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, he would soon out-compete Mark\
      Antony and the anti-Caesarians\
      for support from the Senate, legions, and citizens to become the most powerful man in Rome. In\
      27 BC, the Senate granted him the title 'Augustus' making him the first of the people retroactively\
      called the Roman emperors. His charisma, skill, generosity, and longevity cemented the transition from\
      republic to empire.<br>\
      <br>\
      <b>Administrative</b> He built a permanent civil-service and administrative bureaucracy consisting\
      of slaves and ex-slaves which provided professionalism of administration and continuity between\
      leadership changes. He improved the productivity of the unwieldy Senate by creating a\
      working-group of 30 men that actually made the legislation. He used his massive wealth to fund\
      infrastructure projects such as roads, horse-relay stations, and aqueducts which improved\
      communication and trade. He imposed a regular census to make the tax collection consistant and\
      fair.<br>\
      <br>\
      <b>Diplomacy/Military</b> Augustus thought the empire would soon become over-extended if it grew\
      much bigger. He envisioned an empire that extended to the easily-defensible Danube\
      and Elbe rivers. He settled a favorable peace with the Parthians which saw the return of the Roman\
      legionary standards.<br>\
      <br>\
      <b>Imperial Image & Authority</b> Augustus was the pioneer of the Princeps, or 'first citizen' model\
      of emperor.\ Wary of the stigma surrounding absolute power, he advertized himself as the restorer of\
      the republic. Ironically, the common Romans, tired of the old republican oligarchy, often insisted\
      he seize more power.<br>\
      <br>\
      <b>Religion & Morality</b> He instituted 'morality laws' to try to restore traditional Roman virtue.\
      He outlawed adultery, provided benefits for having children, and made it hard to be single. These\
      laws had little effect though. He also ushered in a revival of Roman religious practices and\
      festivities."

      competition with his rival claimants. His place in power was given and maintained by the army\
      alone. Aware of his fragile authority, Severus gave large donatives and increased the wage of his\
      soldiers. He created new legions and reorganized the Praetorian Guard into a personal army of\
      fifty-thousand men. Having little interest in the charade of republicanism, he ignored the Senate\

      "descr" : "During the mid-third century, the empire nearly fell apart due to a\
      combination of political instability, external invasion, plague, and economic depression.\
      The seeds of the late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages were sown during the crisis\
      years: decreased defense along the northern frontiers, increased city defenses, the\
      decline of the legions, the breakdown of internal trade networks, growing inequality,\
      and the breakdown of the middle class.<br>\
      <br>\
      The Severans had set a precedent for emperors to give large donatives and\
      frequent wage increases to the soldiers to prevent rebellion. The army came to\
      feel so entitled to these benefits that pandering to the army became the only\
      source of imperial legitimacy. Troops elevated their generals to emperor upon\
      glorious victory fueling perpetual civil war. Emperors were deposed by rival\
      generals or when they simply fell out of favor with the army.\
      This breakdown of imperial legitimacy exacerbated external threats and crippled\
      the Roman response. Germanic tribes took notice of the political mess and\
      and conducted raids across the extensive Rhine and Danube frontiers. Meanwhile,\
      the sitting emperor was forced to deal with these threats himself instead of\
      creating potential usurpers by delegating military responsibility to competent\
      generals. Additionally, the Cyprian plague caused widespread manpower shortages\
      that affected army recruitment and economic productivity.<br>\
      <br>\
      The unreasonable monetary demands of the army were also straining the imperial\
      tax system leading emperors to resort to tampering with the Roman currency.\
      Frequent debasement and minting lead to massive inflation such that the western\

      distributing administrative and military duties amongst more officials, thereby allowing\

      <li>Established the Tetrarchy and voluntarily abdicated the throne, setting a\

      <li>Separated civilian and military government positions, such as establishing\
          the position of dux--the military commander in a province</li>\
      <li>Emphasized smaller and more mobile vexillation over the legion as the\
          primary military unit for patrolling the northern frontiers</li>\
      </ul>\
      <b>Economic Reforms</b> His economic reforms aimed to fund the army and bureaucracy\
      despite coin-debasement and inflation. He abandoned monetary taxation in favor of\
      direct payment of raw goods. His Edict on Prices attempted to curb inflation by\
      tabulating for each marketable good a maximum prices. However, the edict was\
      unenforceable and was abandoned after his abdication.<br>\

      marks the boundary between the Principate and Dominate forms of government.<br>\

      Manichaeans from fear that the pagan gods would turn their backs on Rome. However,\

      Constantine is famous for being the emperor who converted Rome to Christianity; and that\
      legacy is certainly well-deserved. His religious convictions influenced nearly every action\
      he took before and after his rise to power, and his unyielding insistance on a single\
      national religion profoundly changed world history. As sole emperor, he built churches,\
      issued morality laws, gave preference to Christians for public positions, and even outlawed\
      the millenium-old pagan practices of divination and sacrifice.<br>\
      <br>\
      Though eventually a fervant Christian, it is difficult to trace\
      his precise religious opinions up to the time he became sole emperor.\
      The rhetoric during his early reign was vaguely monotheistic, but didn't commit to any single\
      belief system. It appears that Constantine was searching for the \"correct\" faith during his\
      rise to power, and later retroactively attributed his successes to the Christian God.\
      His vague religious posture may have been a conscious choice to appeal to a wide range of\
      potential supporters. An idealist,\
      Constantine may have sought to leverage the organization of the early Church heirarchy, contrasted\
      with independent local pagan practice, as a tool of unification.<br>\
      <br>\
      Constantine's monetary policy ultimately separated Romans economically rather than unifying them.\
      While Diocletian had basically abandoned currency, Constantine introduced the gold solidus which\
      would form the backbone of the eastern and western economies for hundreds of years. However, he\
      neglected to stabilize silver and bronze currency which worsened inequality between rich and poor.\
      He also introduced a commercial tax which forced many members of the lower classes to become\
      indentured servants to wealthy landowners. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners, with their new workers,\
      made their estates more self-sufficient to reduce the amount they owed, becoming the\
      precursors of Medieval fiefdoms."

      he retreated to intellectual study of Christian and classic Greek literature and\
      philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the mysticism of Neoplatonism and developed\
      beliefs in theurgy, divination, and the importance of animal sacrifice. In 351, Julian\
      privately rejected his Christian upbringing. In 355, Julian was appointed by Constantius to be\
      Caesar of the west. Although more naturally inclined to private study, the ambitious Julian was\
      determined to master the military demands of his new position. He won crucial victories against\
      invading German tribes and respect from his soldiers.<br>\
      <br>\
      When Constantius died in 361, Julian became sole emperor and wasted no time trying to undo all\
      the work of Diocletian and Constantine. He abandoned the quasi-divine emperor charade,\
      shrank the imperial court and bureaucracy, and redistributed governing power to city\
      and province leaders. However, these reforms mostly caused confusion and didn't last\
      beyond Julian's short reign. More famously, Julian attempted to orchestrate an empire-wide\
      pagan revival by limiting Christians' access to imperial leadership positions. One of his\
      most savvy political moves was his Tolerance Edict which declared all religions\
      equal in the eyes of the state. He reasoned that without imperial sponsorship of \"mainstream\"\
      Christianity, the incohesive religion would be torn apart by its own internal divisions.<br>\
      <br>\
      World history may have been radically different had Julian lived longer. However, his reforms\
      came to a screetching halt when Julian was shot with an arrow in battle during a campaign\
      against the Persians. No doubt, the visionary Julian aspired to be one of the Antonines with\
      their long reigns over a stable and vibrant Roman era. But the crisis years and subsequent\
      reforms had left the empire a vastly different place, and two years was simply not enough\
